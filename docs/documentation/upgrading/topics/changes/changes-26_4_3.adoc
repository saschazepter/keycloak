== Breaking changes

Breaking changes are identified as those that might require changes for existing users to their configurations or applications.
In minor or patch releases, {project_name} will only introduce breaking changes to fix bugs.

=== Accepting only normalized paths in requests

Previously {project_name} accepted HTTP requests with paths containing double dots (`..`) or double slashes (`//`). When processing them, it normalized the path by collapsing double slashes and normalized the path according to RFC3986.
As this has led to a hard-to-configure URL filtering, for example, in reverse proxies, the normalization is now disabled, and {project_name} responds with an HTTP 400 response code.

To analyze rejected requests in the server log, enable debug logging for `org.keycloak.quarkus.runtime.services.RejectNonNormalizedPathFilter`.

To revert to the previous behavior and to accept non-normalized URLs, set the option `http-accept-non-normalized-paths` to `true`. With this configuration, enable and review the HTTP access log to identify problematic requests.

// ------------------------ Notable changes ------------------------ //
== Notable changes

Notable changes may include internal behavior changes that prevent common misconfigurations, bugs that are fixed, or changes to simplify running {project_name}.

=== Allowing realm administrators granted with the `realm-admin` role to assign admin roles

In previous versions, realm administrators granted with the `realm-admin` role were not able to grant admin roles for delegated realm administrators.
This was only possible by granting the `admin` role to a master realm user, making this user a server admin.

In this release, realm administrators with the `realm-admin` role can assign admin roles to users in their realm, allowing them to delegate administrative tasks without needing server admin privileges.

If you are using FGAP to delegate administration to users in a realm other than the master realm,
make sure the users granted with the `realm-admin` role are expected to have this role to avoid privilege scalation.

The documentation is also updated with additional information about the different types of realm administrators.
For more information, see link:{adminguide_link}#_fine_grained_permissions[Delegating realm administration using permissions].

== Deprecated features

The following sections provide details on deprecated features.

=== Accepting HTTP requests with non-normalized paths

The option `http-accept-non-normalized-paths` was introduced to restore the previous behavior where {project_name} accepted non-normalized URLs.

As this behavior can be problematic for URL filtering, it is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
